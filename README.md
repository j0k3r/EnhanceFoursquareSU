# SU Power Tools

**Su Power Tools** is a very lightweight Chrome extension that makes some improvements to the Foursquare SU Tools.

## Enhancement

  * Convert Bing.com link to Google.com
  * Add a link to:
    * Google Maps
    * Twitter & website (if available)
  * Parse all empty value from edit panel and display them above the venue name.
    If there are more than 6 empty values, we don't list them

  * Ability to use Google Maps to automatically fix an address
    * use latitude & longitude if there is no address
    * let the user fixes change or cancel them
    * ability to rollback change
